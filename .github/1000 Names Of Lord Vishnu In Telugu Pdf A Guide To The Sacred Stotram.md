The origin and significance of Vishnu Sahasranama are narrated in the Mahabharata, one of the two major epics of India. According to the legend, after the Kurukshetra war, Bhishma, the grandsire of the Pandavas and Kauravas, was lying on a bed of arrows, waiting for his death. He was visited by Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava and the rightful king of Hastinapura, who asked him for advice on how to rule the kingdom and attain peace and happiness. Bhishma then taught him various aspects of dharma (righteousness), artha (wealth), kama (desire), and moksha (liberation), and finally revealed to him the Vishnu Sahasranama as the ultimate means to attain all four goals.
  
Bhishma said that Vishnu Sahasranama was taught to him by Lord Krishna himself, who is an avatar (incarnation) of Vishnu. He said that by reciting or listening to this stotram with devotion, one can obtain the blessings of Vishnu and fulfill all their wishes. He also said that this stotram can remove all sins, diseases, sorrows, and obstacles in life, and grant wisdom, prosperity, fame, and liberation. He quoted a verse from the stotram that says: "Dharmarthi prapnuyat dharmam artharthi charthamapnuyat / Kamanavapnuyat kami prajanarthi chapnuyat prajam //", which means: "He who desires righteousness obtains righteousness; he who desires wealth obtains wealth; he who desires pleasure obtains pleasure; he who desires progeny obtains progeny."
  
The Vishnu Sahasranama is also found in other Puranas (ancient scriptures) such as the Garuda Purana and the Padma Purana, where it is taught by different speakers to different listeners. However, the most ancient and authoritative version is considered to be the one in the Mahabharata, which has been commented upon by many scholars and saints such as Adi Shankara, Parasara Bhatta, Ramanuja, Madhva, and others. The stotram is divided into three parts: a preface (purva peethika), which contains a prayer (prarthana), a story (katha), an intention (sankalpa), and a meditation (dhyana); the main body (sahasra nama), which contains 1000 names of Vishnu; and an appendix (uttara peethika), which contains a result (phala shruti) and some instructions (upadesha).
  
The 1000 names of Vishnu are not literal names but epithets that describe his various attributes, actions, forms, manifestations, qualities, roles, and relationships. They are derived from various sources such as the Vedas (the oldest scriptures), the Upanishads (the philosophical texts), the Puranas (the mythological stories), the Itihasas (the historical epics), and other texts. Some names are common nouns that denote universal concepts such as truth, beauty, love, etc., while some are proper nouns that refer to specific aspects or incarnations of Vishnu such as Narayana, Rama, Krishna, etc. Some names are synonyms or antonyms that express different facets or perspectives of Vishnu's nature such as Ananta (endless) and Anta (end), Shiva (auspicious) and Shiva (destroyer), etc. Some names are compound words that combine two or more
