They may contain viruses, malware, spyware, or adware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information.

## How to Use Virtual Audio Cable 4.12
 
Once you have installed Virtual Audio Cable 4.12 on your Windows PC, you can start using it to route audio signals between applications or devices. Here are some basic steps to follow:
 
1. Open the VAC Control Panel application from the Start menu or the system tray. You will see a list of virtual cables and their properties, such as sampling rate, bits per sample, number of channels, etc. You can change these properties if you want, but the default settings should work fine for most cases.
2. Open the source application that produces the audio stream you want to transfer. For example, if you want to record the sound of a YouTube video, open your web browser and play the video.
3. Select the output device for the source application. You can do this from the application's settings or from the Windows sound settings. Choose one of the virtual cables as the output device. For example, if you want to use Virtual Cable 1, select "CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)" as the output device.
4. Open the destination application that receives the audio stream you want to transfer. For example, if you want to record the sound of a YouTube video with Audacity, open Audacity and create a new project.
5. Select the input device for the destination application. You can do this from the application's settings or from the Windows sound settings. Choose the same virtual cable as the input device. For example, if you used Virtual Cable 1 as the output device for the source application, select "CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)" as the input device.
6. Start recording or playing the audio stream in both applications. You should hear and see the audio signal being transferred from the source to the destination through the virtual cable.

You can use multiple virtual cables to connect different applications or devices at the same time. You can also use the Audio Repeater application included in Virtual Audio Cable 4.12 to perform more advanced tasks, such as mixing, processing, or broadcasting audio signals.
