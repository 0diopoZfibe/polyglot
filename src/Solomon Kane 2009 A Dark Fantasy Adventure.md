The film was praised for its dark atmosphere, action scenes, and Purefoy's performance as Solomon Kane. However, it was criticized for its clichÃ©d plot, lack of originality, and poor CGI effects. Some fans of Robert E. Howard's stories also complained that the film deviated too much from the source material and did not capture the essence of the character.
 
The film was a box office flop, grossing only $19.6 million worldwide against a budget of $40 million.
